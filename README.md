## Retrointernals

This website is about having a peek under the hood of old video games and seeing how they work. As you can probably tell by the graphics on the site it’s, at least initially, going to be C64 games, but this may change. I am creating the tools as I go but when they reach a certain level of maturity (enough to avoid embracement at a minimum) I’ll publish those too.
