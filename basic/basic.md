## BASIC

I didn’t initially plan writing anything on BASIC at all. When I was working on my disassembler one day it struck me it would be kind of cool the have it handle the SYS in the BASIC header so many C64 games had (mostly after they’d been cracked except for some early games from what I’ve seen). The encoding in pretty simple so I just kept on going after I’d got the SYSes to work and got it the run on entire programs after which I ran it on some. After you see a program on the “big screen” you wonder how the hell anyone ever got these things to work with only 40 columns.
